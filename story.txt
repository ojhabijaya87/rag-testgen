User Story: TfL Journey Planner Widget
As a user,
I want to plan a journey using the Journey Planner widget on the TfL website,
so that I can view possible routes and travel information between my chosen start and end locations.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Valid Journey Planning

When I enter valid locations in the "From" and "To" fields using the auto-complete suggestions (e.g., selecting a station, postcode, or address from the dropdown),

And I select a departure or arrival date and time (using the "Leaving" or "Arriving" radio buttons and date/time pickers),

And I click the "Plan my journey" button,

Then I should see a list of journey options with estimated times for each mode (e.g., public transport, walking, cycling) displayed in the results.

2. Edit Preferences

When I have planned a journey and click the "Edit preferences" link or button,

And I select "Routes with least walking" from the "Show me" dropdown in the preferences panel,

And I click "Update journey",

Then the journey results should update, and the new journey time reflecting the least walking route should be displayed.

3. View Station Details

When I click the "View details" link for the destination station in the journey results,

Then I should see complete accessibility and access information for that station, including step-free access, lift availability, and platform access details.

4. Invalid Journey Handling

When I enter one or more invalid locations (e.g., random text or a location not recognized by the auto-complete) in the "From" or "To" fields,

And I click "Plan my journey",

Then the widget should not provide any journey results and should display an error message such as "We could not find the locations you entered. Please check and try again."

5. Empty Field Validation

When I attempt to plan a journey without entering any locations in the "From" and/or "To" fields,

And I click "Plan my journey",

Then the widget should prevent planning and display an error message such as "Please enter a starting point and destination."

Field names and UI elements such as "From location," "To location," "Plan my journey," "Edit preferences," and journey result details are based on the actual [TfL Plan a Journey page].

Error handling and preference options reflect the real options and messages provided by TfLâ€™s widget.
